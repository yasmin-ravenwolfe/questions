# Questions

If you're in need of some help, but don't happen to be up at MakerSquare HQ, never fear! Your instructors (and classmates) are here to help.

Just [open a new issue](https://github.com/makersquare/questions/issues?state=open) within this repository outlining your problem. Here's some information that's part of a good coding question:

* I tried to run `some command`, I expected this to happen, but this other thing happened instead.
* Here's what I have Googled so far to try and resolve this issue.
* Here's the full text output of any error messages I encountered.

Also remember that GitHub Issues (and comments, for that matter) use [GitHub Flavored Markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/) for formatting. Using GFM to mark up your text will make it more readable. Here's a quick example:

    I tried running `bundle exec rake routes`, but I encountered this error message:

    ```text
    Could not find gem 'new_gem (>= 0) ruby' in the gems available on this machine.
    Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
    ```

Which would look like this:

I tried running `bundle exec rake routes`, but I encountered this error message:

```text
Could not find gem 'new_gem (>= 0) ruby' in the gems available on this machine.
Run `bundle install` to install missing gems.
```
